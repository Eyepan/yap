# TODO: because making sure that I do stuff is important

-   implement `add` command properly
-   implement local config file
-   implement proper semantic versioning with package-json spec
-   implement proper package resolution (tarball links, git links and github links)
-   implement dependency tree, lockfile
-   check if lockfile exists and skip stuff if it has already been done
-   implement pnpm-style flat node_modules structure (by hard-linking packages to .yap and sym-linking deps to each other)
-   checksum verification
-   list command that reads from lock file
