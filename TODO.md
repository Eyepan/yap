# TODO: because making sure that I do stuff is important

## Command Implementation

- [ ]  Implement `add` command properly
- [x]  List command that reads from lock file

## Configuration

- [ ]  Implement local config file

## Versioning and Resolution

- [ ]  Implement proper semantic versioning with package-json spec so that oddball versions are handle-able
- [ ]  Implement proper package resolution (tarball links, git links and github links)

## Dependency Management

- [x]  Implement dependency tree, lockfile
- [x]  Check if lockfile exists and skip stuff if it has already been done
- [half]  Implement pnpm-style flat node_modules structure (by hard-linking packages to .yap and sym-linking deps to each other)

## Verification

- [ ]  Checksum verification

## Miscellaneous

- [x]  Fix tarball extraction logic
- [ ]  Change GitHub workflow.yml to not just say "generated by GitHub actions" in notes, but list out diffing commits from the previous release
