# TODO: because making sure that I do stuff is important

## Command Implementation

- [ ] Implement `add` command properly
- [x] List command that reads from lock file

## Binary Writer
- [ ] How about just writing packages/something else with either an ; or 0x0A ('\n') in between so that I don't have to use complicated logic to read from binary files?

## Configuration

- [ ] Implement local config file
- [ ] Implement proper configuration with either viper
- [ ] Overriding configuration with Cobra (they actually work good together, either I have to use that or I have to come up with something similar. I do want to reinvent the wheel but I don't have the time to do so)

## Versioning and Resolution

- [ ] Move away from binary for metadatas. Only use binary for lockfiles (for faster resolution. TODO: check stats to see which is faster, binary or JSONdecoding metadata from json files)
- [ ] Implement proper semantic versioning with package-json spec so that oddball versions are handle-able
- [ ] Implement proper package resolution (tarball links, git links and github links)

## Dependency Management

- [x] Implement dependency tree, lockfile
- [x] Check if lockfile exists and skip stuff if it has already been done
- [half] Implement pnpm-style flat node_modules structure (by hard-linking packages to .yap and sym-linking deps to each other)

## Verification

- [ ] Checksum verification

## Miscellaneous

- [x] Fix tarball extraction logic
- [ ] Change GitHub workflow.yml to not just say "generated by GitHub actions" in notes, but list out diffing commits from the previous release
