# TODO: because making sure that I do stuff is important

## Command Implementation

-   Implement `add` command properly
-   List command that reads from lock file

## Configuration

-   Implement local config file

## Versioning and Resolution

-   Implement proper semantic versioning with package-json spec so that oddball versions are handle-able
-   Implement proper package resolution (tarball links, git links and github links)

## Dependency Management

-   Implement dependency tree, lockfile
-   Check if lockfile exists and skip stuff if it has already been done
-   Implement pnpm-style flat node_modules structure (by hard-linking packages to .yap and sym-linking deps to each other)

## Verification

-   Checksum verification

## Miscellaneous

-   Fix tarball extraction logic
-   Change GitHub workflow.yml to not just say "generated by GitHub actions" in notes, but list out diffing commits from the previous release
